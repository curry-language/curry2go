--- This module defines the interface of properties that can be checked
--- with the CurryCheck tool, an automatic property-based test tool
--- based on the EasyCheck library.
--- The ideas behind EasyCheck are described in the
--- [FLOPS 2008 paper](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-540-78969-7_23).
--- CurryCheck automatically tests properties defined with this library.
--- CurryCheck supports the definition of unit tests
--- (also for I/O operations) and property tests parameterized
--- over some arguments. CurryCheck is described in more detail in the
--- [LOPSTR 2016 paper](http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-63139-4_13).
---
--- Basically, this module is a stub clone of the EasyCheck library
--- which contains only the interface of the operations used to specify
--- properties. Hence, this library does not import any other library.
--- This supports the definition of properties in any other module
--- (execept for the prelude).
