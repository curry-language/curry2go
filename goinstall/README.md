Installation helpers
====================

This directory contains some Go "main" programs to install
an already compiled/bootstrapped Curry2Go compiler/REPL/CPM
with a Go compiler on another machine.

Furthermore, the script `download.sh` can be used to perform
the installation automatically by downloading the current
version of Curry2Go, see the
[installation instructions](https://github.com/curry-language/curry2go/blob/master/INSTALL.md).
